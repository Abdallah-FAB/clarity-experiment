# Clarity Experiment Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modern Frontend Stack
The project will use ReactJS with Vite as the primary technology stack. This ensures a fast development experience and access to modern JavaScript features. All new features and experiments must be compatible with this stack.

### II. Best-in-Class Architecture
We will follow industry best practices for frontend architecture. This includes component-based design, state management, and a clear separation of concerns. The goal is to create a maintainable and scalable codebase.

### III. Focus on Experimentation
The primary purpose of this project is to experiment with external tools and integrations. Features should be designed to be modular and easily adaptable for different experiments.

### IV. Frontend-Only with Mock Data
This is a frontend-only application. No backend will be developed. All data will be mocked or generated. This allows for rapid prototyping and iteration without the need for a live data source.

## Development Workflow

All development should follow the guidelines outlined in the project's README.md file. Pull requests are required for all code changes and must be reviewed by at least one other team member.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for the project's principles and practices. Any amendments to this constitution must be proposed via a pull request and approved by the project maintainers.
