# Implementation Plan: Customer List and Details View

**Branch**: `001-customer-list-view` | **Date**: 2025-10-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/abdallahali/workspace/clarity-experiement/specs/001-customer-list-view/spec.md`

## Summary

This feature will create a two-page React application to display a list of bank customers and their details. The application will be built with Vite and TypeScript, and will use shadcn/ui for components. Data will be mocked.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, shadcn/ui
**Storage**: N/A (mock data)
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Customer list page loads in under 2 seconds, details page in under 1 second.
**Constraints**: Frontend-only application.
**Scale/Scope**: A 2-page application displaying a list of customers and a detail view for each.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Modern Frontend Stack**: The project will use ReactJS with Vite as the primary technology stack. This ensures a fast development experience and access to modern JavaScript features. All new features and experiments must be compatible with this stack.
- **II. Best-in-Class Architecture**: We will follow industry best practices for frontend architecture. This includes component-based design, state management, and a clear separation of concerns. The goal is to create a maintainable and scalable codebase.
- **III. Focus on Experimentation**: The primary purpose of this project is to experiment with external tools and integrations. Features should be designed to be modular and easily adaptable for different experiments.
- **IV. Frontend-Only with Mock Data**: This is a frontend-only application. No backend will be developed. All data will be mocked or generated. This allows for rapid prototyping and iteration without the need for a live data source.

**Structure Decision**: A single `frontend` directory will be used, as this is a frontend-only application.
