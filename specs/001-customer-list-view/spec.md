**Why this priority**: This is the main entry point of the application and is essential for any other user actions.

### User Story 2 - View Customer Details (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to be able to click on a customer from the list and navigate to a details page, so that I can view all of their information, including PII and sensitive data.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the application, allowing users to view detailed information about a customer.

**Independent Test**: Clicking a customer on the list should navigate to a new page that displays all the details of that customer.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the customer list is displayed, **When** the user clicks on a customer, **Then** the application navigates to the customer details page for that customer.
2. **Given** the customer details page is displayed, **When** the user inspects the page, **Then** all the customer's details, including PII and sensitive data, are visible.
