# Feature Specification: Revamp Application with shadcn/ui

**Feature Branch**: `001-shadcn-ui-revamp`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "revamp the application using shadcn/ui components, never use just raw divs or html elements, everything needs to be from shadcn"

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - Consistent UI across application (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the application to have a modern and consistent look and feel, so that it is visually appealing and easy to use. This will be achieved by replacing all raw HTML elements with their equivalent `shadcn/ui` components.

**Why this priority**: This is the core of the feature request and directly addresses the user's desire for a revamped application using `shadcn/ui`.

**Independent Test**: The application should display all UI elements using `shadcn/ui` components, and there should be no raw `div`s or other basic HTML elements used for structural or interactive purposes where a `shadcn/ui` component exists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** I navigate through different pages, **Then** all visible UI elements (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) are rendered using `shadcn/ui` components.
2. **Given** a form is displayed, **When** I interact with form elements (e.g., input fields, checkboxes), **Then** they should behave and appear as `shadcn/ui` components.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a `shadcn/ui` component does not directly map to an existing raw HTML element? (e.g., a complex layout that might require custom composition of `shadcn/ui` primitives).
- How does the system handle responsiveness and accessibility when using `shadcn/ui` components? (Assumed to be handled by `shadcn/ui` itself).

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The application MUST replace all existing raw HTML elements (e.g., `div`, `button`, `input`, `p`, `h1`, etc.) with their corresponding `shadcn/ui` components where applicable.
- **FR-002**: The application MUST maintain existing functionality and user flows after the UI revamp.
- **FR-003**: The application MUST ensure that the styling and behavior of `shadcn/ui` components are consistent with the `shadcn/ui` design system.

### Key Entities

- **UI Components**: The various interactive and display elements of the application's user interface.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of all interactive UI elements (buttons, inputs, forms) are replaced with `shadcn/ui` components.
- **SC-002**: 90% of all display UI elements (headings, paragraphs, containers) are replaced with `shadcn/ui` components or composed using `shadcn/ui` primitives.
- **SC-003**: No regressions in existing application functionality are introduced due to the UI revamp.
- **SC-004**: The application's visual consistency score (as determined by a visual inspection) is improved by at least 20%.

## Assumptions

- Responsiveness and accessibility for `shadcn/ui` components are handled by the `shadcn/ui` library itself.
