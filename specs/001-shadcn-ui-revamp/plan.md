# Implementation Plan: Revamp Application with shadcn/ui

**Branch**: `001-shadcn-ui-revamp` | **Date**: 2025-10-29 | **Spec**: /Users/abdallahali/workspace/clarity-experiement/specs/001-shadcn-ui-revamp/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-shadcn-ui-revamp/spec.md`

## Summary

This feature aims to revamp the application by replacing all raw HTML elements with their corresponding `shadcn/ui` components, ensuring a modern, consistent, and visually appealing user interface.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, shadcn/ui
**Storage**: N/A (Frontend-only with mock data)
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: The application should load pages and render UI elements smoothly, with no noticeable lag during user interactions.
**Constraints**: Frontend-only application.
**Scale/Scope**: The revamp will cover all existing UI elements in the current application.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Modern Frontend Stack
**Evaluation**: PASS. The feature uses React, Vite, and TypeScript, aligning with the modern frontend stack principle.

### II. Best-in-Class Architecture
**Evaluation**: PASS. Utilizing `shadcn/ui` promotes component-based design and a clear separation of concerns, contributing to a maintainable and scalable codebase.

### III. Focus on Experimentation
**Evaluation**: PASS. Integrating `shadcn/ui` is an experiment with an external tool, aligning with the focus on experimentation.

### IV. Frontend-Only with Mock Data
**Evaluation**: PASS. The feature is implemented as a frontend-only application using mock data, adhering to this principle.
